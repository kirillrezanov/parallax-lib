# parallax-lib
Hello, I'm Kirill Rezanov and it's my second library. It's allow you to use parallax simply effect and adjust speed for this effect. How can you use it? It's so easy. You don't need use any libraries as jQuery. You should create an instance of a class "Parallax" and send 3 parameters: element, speed and direction.
For example:

new Parallax(element, 1, true);

The higher the speed value in second parameter, the lower the speed.

Direction parameter contains one value true or false, true - down, false - to top.
